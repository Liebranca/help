# HELP!

This one is part serious and part gimmick; the serious part, it's a utility for *helping* me generate a --help message that lists the available options without them wrapping weirdly in my tty.

The gimmick part is this: when asking help for --help, it will silently demonstrate usage by calling itself to generate the message, and then display it to you.
